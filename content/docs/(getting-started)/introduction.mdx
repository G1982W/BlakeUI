# Introduction

Skip the months of implementation - we have turned the design system into production-ready code blocks you can drop into your project. Get pixel-perfect, accessible components without sacrificing customization or control.

## Why Copy/Paste?

Instead of distributing components as an npm package, this setup provides source code directly in your project. This gives you:

- Complete control over implementation
- Freedom to customize and extend components
- No dependency lock-in
- Direct access to styles and behavior

## Built for Production

Each component is built on proven foundations:

- Core behaviors powered by Radix UI
- Styling through Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript for type safety
- Accessibility built in
